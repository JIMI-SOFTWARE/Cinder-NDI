Cinder block for Newtek's [NDI](http://newtek.com/ndi) video-over-IP protocol.

You will need to [download](http://pages.newtek.com/NDI-Developers.html) the NDI SDK seperately as currently the license does not permit shipping it with 3rd party software.

Before building the samples you will need to export the `NDI_SDK_PATH` env variable to the directory where you unzipped the NDI SDK.
